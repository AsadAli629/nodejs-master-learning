# What is Node.js?

Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime environment** built on Google Chrome’s V8 engine.  
It allows JavaScript to run **outside the browser**, mainly on servers and backend systems.

---

## Why Node.js Was Created
Before Node.js, JavaScript could only run inside browsers.  
Developers needed a way to build **servers, APIs, real-time apps**, and backend systems using JavaScript.  
Node.js solved this by enabling JS to run on your machine like any other programming language (Python, Java, C#, etc.).

## Key Features of Node.js

### 1. **Asynchronous & Non-Blocking**
Node.js uses an **event-driven architecture**, meaning it does not block the execution of other code while waiting for operations like:
- File reading  
- Database queries  
- Network operations  

Instead, it uses callbacks, promises, and async/await.

---

### 2. **Single-Threaded but Very Fast**
Even though Node.js uses a **single thread**, it can handle thousands of operations using the event loop.

---

### 3. **Built on V8 Engine**
Node.js executes JS code extremely fast thanks to Google’s V8 engine.

---

### 4. **Cross-Platform**
Node.js works on:
- Windows  
- Mac  
- Linux

## Where Node.js is Commonly Used

✔ Backend APIs  
✔ Real-time apps (chat, notifications)  
✔ E-commerce platforms  
✔ Streaming platforms  
✔ Command-line tools (npm, webpack, vite, eslint)  
✔ Microservices  
✔ IoT device handling

## Why Developers Love Node.js?

- Same language for frontend and backend (JavaScript)
- Fast development
- Huge package ecosystem (npm)
- Scalable architecture

---

## Summary
Node.js is a backend runtime that uses JavaScript to build fast, scalable, and modern applications.  
It is widely used in the industry and is beginner-friendly.
